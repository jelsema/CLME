===========================
PROJECTED DEVELOPMENT:
- Better handling of environments (currently non-existant)
- Better formula parsing (hopefully to remove dependence on lme4::lFormula 
  so that I don't have to add/drop a trivial random effect).
- Improvements to GUI in shiny_clme(), particularly:
  - Plots/summary for data when main response variable is not a factor
    or when there are multiple variables instead of a single factor
- Implement unconstrained model testing all pairwise comparisons.
- Add argument to not bootstrap the random effect residuals. See Morris (2002) doi:10.1016/S0167-7152(02)00041-X
  - How does lme4 handle this, just use the exact random effects?
- Enable parallel processing for the bootstrap samples (foreach, dopar).

===========================
VERSION HISTORY:

Version 2.0-4, 2015-07-01
- Fixed error in logLik.clme.
- Changed maintainer email.
- Added explicit BIC.clme method (instead of forcing custom use of AIC.clme)
- Removed the bootstrap computations from clme() and put them into summary.clme(). 
- summary.clme() now returns a list of values (largely equivalent to output of 
  clme()) but does not automatically print output to console.
- print.summary.clme() prints the output of summary.clme to the console.
- Improvements to the shiny_clme() application:
  - Added "model running" indicator
  - Enabled tab-delimited and xlsx formatted data input
  - Multiple tabs for output.


Version 2.0-3, 2015-05-14
- Noted nsim is in the fitted object of clme().
- Fixed error with method VarCorr() (failed unless "lme4" or "nlme" was loaded, 
  redefined method VarCorr)
- Replaced vignette with static document.
- Implemented work-around to prevent error (stemming from package isotone) when 
  there was only 1 constraint.


Version 2.0-2, 2015-01-20
- Fixed typo in printing of log-likelihood, AIC, BIC
- Added ellipses to MINQUE function to prevent errors from arguments em.eps and em.iter
- Improvements to shiny_clme() application


Version 2.0-1, 2014-12-05
- Minor updates to several functions


Version 2.0-0, 2014-12-01
- Major changes to arguments, particularly:
  - Formula interface implemented
  - Removed necessity for custom PAVA algorithms (implemented function 'activeSet'
    from package isotone)
  - Nks replaced with group vector input
  - Qs removed, each random term now gets individual variance
- Provided more common methods for fitted objects

Version 1.0-0, 2014-09-09
- Initial release of package
