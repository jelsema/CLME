===========================
PROJECTED DEVELOPMENT:
- Better handling of environments (currently non-existant)
- Improvements to GUI in shiny_clme(), particularly:
  - Plots/summary for data when main response variable is not a factor
    or when there are multiple variables instead of a single factor
- Better formula parsing
